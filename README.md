# OldCoolProjects
Hi, I have been coding since when I was 16. I am going to host these old codes here. I do not guarantee that these will work in your mechine. These codes are in no way optimised and are meant to be run in my mechine only. Anyways, feel free to explore. Download some of them, see if they work on your mechine. And of course give feedback at [YeaminSarderSR@gmail.com]
